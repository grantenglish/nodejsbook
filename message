Lloyd,

I hope you had a great weekend.

I just wanted to check in to make sure we're still on for 2pm tomorrow.  Please let me know if there's anything additional I need to do, I believe my GDIT careers site profile is up to date.

Can you tell me who I will be meeting with and their roles please?

Also an address for the office.

Thanks,
Grant English
